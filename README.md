<h2>Overview</h2>
This was a quick and dirtly little project. The idea was that my little brother was learning javascript and had made numerous games in using a browser IDE over at Khan Academy. He was using a js library called processing to do his graphics, and I took it apon myself to create him a website to host his projects on. This website was very bare bones, and was very rushed to meet his deadline. It did however work. He used it and posted several projects to before moving on to learn Java. It is not currently hosted and needs some more work to be anything useful on a produciton scale. It was a fun little proof of concept however, and we enjoyed messing with it
